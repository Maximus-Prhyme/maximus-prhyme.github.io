		<h1>My Mission</h1>
		<P>I want to create, build, innovate, and inspire. I want people to see my work and feel that they can reach the potential and the destiny that they were meant. I want to make people want and see the best in themselves.

		I know enough to know that I will never know enough, that there is something to learn in every situation, that if you are not learning you are not growing.

		I have on display some code that I was able to put together after just 12 weeks of working with 5 different languages in a full web stack with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some JQuery. Again, this was after only 12 weeks working with coding. I have recently quit my job to dedicate my time to coding. To hone and perfect my craft as best I can. I am focused, driven, and dedicated to becoming the best that I can be. In coding, in health, in personal development. 

		My skills are not currently top notch, but my passion to better myself and desire to learn and grow are unmatched.

		I am on a journey to fulfill my destiny, whatever I deem that to be, I am the engineer of my own fate. If you would like to be a part of this journey I am on. Please, contact me!   
		</P>

		<img src="Wyncode">
		<p>Wyncode, and immersive 12 week bootcamp, in which I quit my job as a computer tech to dive into this new tech world developing in Miami. It taught me the struggles of working on a difficult coding project having to make deadlines. It taught me to work with a team developing these projects, along with version control.</p>
		<img src="CoffeeBreak">
		<p>Before Wyncode I found myself stuck in a very unfulfilling job. And I have once again found myself in that position, this time however, I have the tools necessary to break myself out of it. I will build and continue building until there is nothing left to build.</p>
